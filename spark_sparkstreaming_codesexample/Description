Description

Let us write a program to compute dense ranking
Use NYSE end of day stock data
This is example for groupByKey as well as functional programming using scala
Problem Statement

Use sbt with Eclipse or intellij to develop this
Get top N stocks by volume for each day or month
Use the scala interpreter and preview the data after each step using Spark APIs
Develop the program using sbt and eclipse or intellij
Develop topNStocks function - function should take 2 parameters
First Parameter - Tuple of date or month and then list of stocks for that date or month
Second Parameter - topN
Function should sort data in descending order and return top N stocks
If there are more than N stocks in topN print all stocks (dense rank)
Compile the jar, ship it and run it on the lab
Output format - Date or month, Stock Name, Volume (all 3 fields should be delimited by \t)
Determine number of executors used to run
Determine number of executor tasks used to run
Understand DAG for each stage
